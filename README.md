# Linear Regression with PyTorch

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Linear Regression with PyTorch" project! This project provides a comprehensive guide and implementation of linear regression using the PyTorch library in Python. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library, provides efficient tools for building and training neural networks, making it an excellent choice for implementing linear regression models.

## Features
- Implementation of simple linear regression and multiple linear regression using PyTorch.
- Utilization of PyTorch's automatic differentiation feature for efficient gradient computation.
- Training and evaluation of linear regression models on synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Visualization of model predictions and performance metrics.
